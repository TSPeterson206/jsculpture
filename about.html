      <div class="aboutTextRow aboutText">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI have used art as a way to experience the world since childhood. Being creative has always been my avocation, which I have used to balance my vocation as an oncology RN for over 40 years. I have been sculpting since college in various mediums but working in stone has become my passion. I am now retired, which gives me more time to devote to perfecting my skills. 

        Sculpting is a meditative experience that allows me to immerse myself totally in my work. Time and the stress of the day are forgotten. Working by hand to expose something hidden in the rock brings me joy. I may begin a sculpture with an idea, but many times I allow the stone to guide me, which is often the most surprising outcome.
        
        Thank you for visiting my site. I hope my work brings you enjoyment. Please contact me with any comments or questions you may have at jds.smith@comcast.net. </div>
